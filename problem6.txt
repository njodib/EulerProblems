Sum Square Difference
Paper solution

Sum square difference of first N natural numbers:
(1 + 2 + ... + N)^2 - (1^2 + 2^2 + ... + N^2)
    = ((N/2)(N+1))^2 - (N/6)(N+1)(2N+1)
    = (N^4 + 2N^3 + N^2)/4 - (2N^3 + 3N^2 + N)/6
    = (3N^4 + 2N^3 - 3N^2 - 2N)/12

Sum square difference of first 100 natural numbers:
(3(100)^4 + 2(100)^3 - 3(100)^2 - 2(100))/12
    = 25,164,150
